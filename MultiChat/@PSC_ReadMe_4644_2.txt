Title: Multi User Voice Chat (VOIP)
Description: Multi User Voice Chat And Multi-Threaded TCP Server, 8,000F 8k mono sound, some basic lossy "compression" :) that gets the rates down to 3-6k depending on the settings and the data. Works on webpages, Applet and application code included. You can type /help for a list of commands. You can have as many users logged in as your bandwith can support. To test this you can run two clients on the same machine. Contact Outsiderook on AIM if you have any questions or comments. If you contact me wait for a response dont give me your e-mails and log off I will NOT send e-mail to anyone.
