Recording
-----------
Recorder.run() reads in bytes and sticks them into CommonSoundClass.writebyte(byte[])
which puts them into a vector

ProcessRecordedSoundThread.run() reads data from the CommonSoundClass vector
if the length < 10
	write and then clears the content in CSC
else
    ...	

Playing
---------
ChatClient.run receives the data and sticks it in receivedByteVector by checking if data ends
	in breaker or bytes read == the max size of 3071
ClientMessageHandlerThread.run reads data that's in receivedByteVector


Server Handling
----------------------
Server reads in data in ChatHandler.run() and puts it into the receivedByteVector

Server processes in ReceivedQueueProcessorThread.run which calls processData
	If data is >= 100 bytes, it assumes it's audio and just writes the data out
	Every 8 audio pieces it sends the talking indicator to everyone
	Writes audio to everyone except the speaker

Server sends outgoing data in ServerSendThread.run by reading from CommonSOundClass and
	just writing it out

Notes
-------
Queue has queueWaitSize set to wait for 12 queued sound items before playing. Changing to 1 or 0
greatly decreases the delay.
